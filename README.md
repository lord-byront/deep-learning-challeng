This analysis evaluates a deep learning model trained to predict the success of applications using structured data. The goal is to assess the model's performance, identify key findings, and explore alternative modeling approaches to improve accuracy beyond 72%.

The dataset was preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features using StandardScaler. The data was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

## Model Performance

The final evaluation on the test set yielded:

Loss: 0.5607

Accuracy: 72.45%

The current deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 72.45%, which is a significant improvement over random guessing but may still require further enhancements. To reach and exceed the 75% target, additional optimizations such as architectural modifications, hyperparameter tuning, and alternative machine learning models  should be explored.
